Hi George,

Here is the location of the files on HPC:
/home/rcf-proj/hm/mi/proj/P01/proj2/

‘experimental_function' contains all the functional annotations through manual curation. It is the one you should use in your model.
‘phylogenetic_function’ contains all the inferred annotations from the phylogenetic curation project. It is something you can use to compare with your inferences.

Both files have 4 columns:
Col 1  Node id, for example “PTHR10005:AN136”. 
Col 2  Leaf sequence ID, for example "HUMAN|HGNC=10896|UniProtKB=P12755”.
Col 3  GO id, for example "GO:0000122”. 
Col 4  Annotation qualifier (NOT). 

Let me know if you have any questions. By the way if you have a slide or 2 that you would like to include in my talk, please send them over to me.

Thanks,

Huaiyu
