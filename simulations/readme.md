# Simulations

The tabulations and plots are in `../figures` and `../tables`.

*   _01-informative-force_: Simulations in which both the data generating process and the droping of annotations is done such that all is informative, i.e. all trees have both 0s and 1s.

*   _02-gold-standard_: Simulations in which informative data is not forced in any fashion. The problem with this approach is that several of the observed trees will be noninformative as the parameter estimates will be biased or converging to the prior.
