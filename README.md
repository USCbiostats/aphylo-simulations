# On the automatic annotation of gene functions usingobservational data and phylogenetic trees

This repository contains all the materials that are necesary to reproduce the
figures and tables of the paper.

There are two main sections: the simulations folder and the novel-predictions
folder. The first deals with the simulation study generating random annotated
phylogenetic trees using the PANTHER database, the latter fits the pooled-data
model using 141 different sets of annotations and makes the predictions, all
using a combination between the GO dataset and the PANTHER phylogenetic trees.

The simulation study uses PANTHER version 15.0.
