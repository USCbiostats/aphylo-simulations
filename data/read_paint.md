Hi, George

The files you need are in /auto/rcf-proj3/hm/mi/PAINT/curation/paint_curated
In each PTHR##### directory:
There are several files you will need:

The tree file: *.tree
the exp file for experimental evidences  *.exp
the gaf file for curator's decisions *gaf
the attr file for linking lables in tree file, exp file and gaf file

I could probably help you generate the data in formats that suit the mcmc. 
Please let me know what do you need!

Thanks
Haiming
