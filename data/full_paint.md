Hi George,

Here is the file with the most updated annotation for the leaf sequences.
/auto/rcf-proj/hm/xiaosonh/fullgo_paint/fullgo_paint_081517/Pthr_GO.tsv

The file format is as below.
col 1:  long sequence ID
col 2:  GO id
col 3:  Qualifier, such as ‘NOT’
col 4:  evidence code.

You probably don’t need to worry about col 5 and 6.
The file contains both computational and experimental annotations. You need to filter them with the evidence code column to only include the following: IDA, EXP, IPI, IMP, IGI, IEP.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,

Huaiyu
