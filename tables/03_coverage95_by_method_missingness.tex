\caption{Coverage probability at the 95\% level by prior (right/wrong), and proportion of missingness. Estimations with the \emph{right} prior use the same priors as the data generating process, whereas estimations with the \emph{wrong} prior used a prior that had a mean twice as large as the data generating process.}
